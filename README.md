# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Introduction

- Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and are essential for solving complex problems efficiently. This repository aims to provide Python implementations of commonly used data structures 
- and algorithms, along with explanations and examples.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

- Stack
- Queue

# PS: I will upload other data strcurues and algorithms notebooks as well

Each data structure is implemented as a Python class with methods for common operations.

## Algorithms

- I will upload algorithms notebooks as well

## Usage

To use the data structures and algorithms in your Python projects, you can clone this repository or download the specific Python files you need. Then, import the classes or functions into your Python code and use them as required.

# Stack data structure
Example usage:

# Create a stack
stack = Stack()

# Push elements onto the stack
stack.push(10)
stack.push(20)
stack.push(30)

# Pop elements from the stack
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 30
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 20

# Queue data structure
Example usage:

# Create a queue
queue = Queue()

# Enqueue elements into the queue
queue.enqueue(10)
queue.enqueue(20)
queue.enqueue(30)

# Dequeue elements from the queue
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 10
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 20
